## Welcome to Identity Proofing Web Application!

Identity Proofing Web Application is a software that supports the process of ensuring that applicants are who they claim
to be, with a certain confidence level that gives service providers the assurance they need to proceed with onboarding
and grant access to their services. For the installation purposes please follow both backend (idv-api) and frontend
(idv-front) README files:

* [idv-api](idv-api/README.md)
* [idv-front](idv-front/README.md)

### Update: Docserver flow

On 2022-01-13, the implementation using DocServer has been replaced with new, GIPS-only flow. Please consult `legacy` branch in case you still want to reference
an older version of this demo.
